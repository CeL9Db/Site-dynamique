                                for Codes is the price displayed in conjunction with the particular 
                                Content on the order pages when you place your order. The price for 
                                Codes will generally default to the national currency for the location 
                                from which you access the Website. You may select an alternative currency 
                                from the options made available on the Website. In which case, the price 
                                for Codes will be displayed and paid in your chosen currency. If VAT is 
                                payable on our sale of Codes the price we display will include VAT at the 
                                applicable rate. Prices do not include the cost of mobile data or any other 
                                costs charged by your mobile communications provider. Pricing and availability 
                                of all Codes displayed through the Website are subject to change at any time 
                                prior to purchase.

                                <u>4.2</u>   We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT. If the rate of VAT 
                                changes between your order date and the date we supply the Content, we will 
                                adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the 
                                Content in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.

                                <u>4.3</u>   What happens if we got the price wrong. Sometimes we may 
                                mistakenly publish the wrong price or product information. If this happens 
                                to Codes you have ordered we will tell you as soon as possible by email and 
                                give you the chance to reconfirm your order (at the correct price or with 
                                other correct information) or cancel the order. If we do not hear from you 
                                we will treat your order as cancelled. If you cancel and have already paid 
                                us we will refund you in full. Irish Company manages the payment of eligible 
                                refunds on behalf of Instant Gaming.

                                <u>4.4</u>   When you must pay and how to pay. We do not accept cash but we

                                card to facilitate your purchase of Codes through the Website. You must comply

                                you choose to use to pay for Codes. We may add or remove payment processing methods
